# Use Cases for the Statsomat/CFA app

This repository contains use data cases and testing results for the Statsomat/CFA app (https://github.com/Statsomat/CFA). The testing results are saved in the file `Tests_CFA.xlsx`. Each use data case is located in the `Cases` folder and contains:  

•	a CSV file which can be used with the Statsomat/CFA app  
•	a model in `lavaan` syntax to be typed directly in the browser of the app 
•	links and references for the dataset and for the CFA interpretation, to be compared to the interpretation delivered by the Statsomat/CFA app
