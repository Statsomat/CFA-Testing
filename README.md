# Datasets for ML and for the Statsomat/CFA app

Each use data case for the CFA app contains:  

•	a CSV file which can be used with the Statsomat/CFA app  
•	a model in `lavaan` syntax to be typed directly in the browser of the app 
•	links and references for the dataset and for the CFA interpretation, to be compared to the interpretation delivered by the Statsomat/CFA app
