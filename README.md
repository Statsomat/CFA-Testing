# CFA-Testing

This repository contains the testing data cases and results for the app https://github.com/Statsomat/CFA. The test results are saved in the file `Tests_CFA.xlsx`. The testing data cases are located in the `Cases` folder and are made of:  

•	a CSV file to be uploaded to the Statsomat/CFA app 
•	a model in `lavaan` syntax (saved as a TXT file) to be typed directly in the browser of the app  
•	references for the dataset and for the interpretation, to be compared to the text interpretation delivered by the Statsomat/CFA app
