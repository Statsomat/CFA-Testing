# CFA-Testing

This repository contains testing data cases and testing results for the app https://github.com/Statsomat/CFA. The test results are saved in the file `Tests_CFA.xlsx`. The testing data cases are located in the `Cases` folder and are made of:  

•	a CSV file to be uploaded to the Statsomat/CFA app  
•	a model in `lavaan` syntax to be typed directly in the browser of the app, saved in `Cases/model.txt`  
•	links and references for the dataset and for the interpretation, to be compared to the text interpretation delivered by the Statsomat/CFA app, saved in `Cases/sources.txt`
